# Kettle

Equipment for heating water to brewing temperature.

## Equipment Options
- **Traditional stovetop kettle**: Manual control, lower cost
- **Electric kettle**: Automated, temperature control
- **Commercial water boiler**: High volume, consistent temperature
- **Instant hot water system**: On-demand, space efficient

## Current Evolution
The kettle is evolving from basic heating device to smart appliance:
- Temperature presets for different tea types
- Digital temperature displays
- Automatic shut-off features
- Energy efficiency improvements

## Performance Requirements
- Capacity: Match daily service volume
- Speed: Heat water quickly during peak times
- Temperature control: Accurate and consistent
- Reliability: Minimal downtime
- Energy efficiency: Control operating costs

## Strategic Position
Currently in transition phase - standardizing around electric kettles with temperature control. Considering upgrade to commercial-grade equipment as volume grows.

## Maintenance
- Regular descaling (mineral buildup)
- Heating element inspection
- Thermostat calibration
- Power cord safety checks
